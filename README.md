# Kanban task managment fullstack app (trello clone)

an app that helps you manage your tasks in a simillar way to the popular app Trello.

## Tech Stack

The app uses next.js, prisma(postgreSQL), next-auth, typescript, axios, tailwindcss, class-variance-authority.

### next.js, prisma and next-auth

I used next because it's convenient to have one base for both my FE and BE, it integrates with prisma very well and it can generate types that can be used in both front and back end, which is both convenient and safe, I use next-auth because it's well documented and follows the best practices for user authentication.

### tailwindcss & class-variance-authority

CVA allows me to make my react components more reuseable and efficient by using variants for my components, you can see many examples of this in my projects because reusing components helps retain the design language and consistency of the app. simple example is the Button.tsx component.
